Founded in 1975 out of the back of a red El Camino Chris needed some help. He looked to noneother than several off-duty local police officers to help with coffee deliveries and his wife Pattie to take on paperwork and phone calls. To this day, Chris' Coffee remains local and a family business with Pattie and Chris' daughters taking on ownership of the tried and true business built by their parents. 45 Employees, including a full-service commercial and consumer service team, we roast over 100,000 pounds of coffee per month and are the exclusive importer of italian espresso machines to more than 40 distrutors throughout North America.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.chriscoffee.com/aboutus.asp" target="_blank">Read More About Us</a>
